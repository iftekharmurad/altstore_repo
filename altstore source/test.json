Preview: https://twitter.com/UTMapp/status/1475606159428046854\r\n* **QEMU v6.2.0**: Updated QEMU backend to the latest release. Full changelog: https://wiki.qemu.org/ChangeLog/6.2\r\n* (iOS 13+) **New toolbar**: The new toolbar is much more compact and friendly for smaller displays. It is also now movable and does not interfere with the iOS 15 multitasking button on the top center of the screen. Preview: https://twitter.com/UTMapp/status/1407350167494443023\r\n* (macOS 12+, ARM64) **Virtualize macOS 12**: New integration with Apple's Virtualization.framework backend allows native hardware accelerated virtualization of macOS 12 (supporting both CPU and GPU virtualization). UTM can also download the latest macOS installer directly from Apple. (This is only supported on macOS 12+ running on an ARM64 Mac.)\r\n* (macOS 11+) **Virtualize Linux with Apple backend**: You now have the option to use Apple's Virtualization.framework to virtualize Linux. Note that while there are some performance benefits, it is still recommended to use the QEMU backend as it is more stable, has more device support (including graphical display), and is easier to configure.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* The default CPU for ARM64 virtual machine has changed from `cortex-a72` to `default`. This is the recommended option and you should change your existing VMs to use it. When using virtualization on M1(X) macOS, the `cortex-a72` CPU is known to have compatibility issues which causes the VM to sometimes freeze (including during Windows install). `default` will use the `host` CPU model when virtualization is used and `cortex-a72` when emulation is used.\r\n* The GL hardware acceleration support is now marked experimental to highlight that it is not stable. It is also no longer the default option. If you are experiencing lots of crashes, make sure that you chose a display hardware that is **not** marked as \"GPU Supported\".\r\n* The cursor and resolution change issues on ARM64 Windows has been fixed in [SPICE tools 0.164.3][3]. If you are using an older version and experience such issues, please update to the latest SPICE tools.\r\n* If you manually added `virtualization=on` to your VM machine properties, you should remove it.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.0.4)\r\n* Introduced option to disable RNG device, which causes issues on FreeBSD (#3493)\r\n* Wizard: directory sharing is now enabled by default\r\n* Changed the default USB 3.0 controller from `qemu-xhci` to `nec-usb-xhci` which addresses an issue where the DVD drive disconnects randomly on Windows ARM64 and causes random errors during setup (#3194)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed save panel opening when you try to close the settings (#3494)\r\n* (macOS) Hide unsupported directory sharing options in macOS guests (#3496)\r\n* (macOS) Fix invert scrolling option (thanks @ktprograms) (#3497)\r\n* (macOS) Apple VM config files are now in plain-text (thanks @ktprograms)\r\n* (macOS) Hide non-disk drives from the drives icon menu and properly describe the \"EFI Variables\" \"drive\" in settings\r\n* (macOS) Fixed suspend save state being broken in a previous update\r\n* (macOS) Fixed a crash when a toolbar icon is hidden due to small window size and a toolbar option is selected from the menu\r\n* (macOS) The stop button in the main window will now stop the VM if it is started\r\n* (iOS) Wizard: Fix disabled button colour being the same as enabled buttons\r\n* (iOS) Moved the toolbar icon lower to not collide with the touch target for showing control center\r\n* (iOS) Fixed an issue where settings are not shown if the context menu is used to open it (#3513)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.0.3)\r\n* Improvements to download UI (thanks @conath) (#3432)\r\n* Wizard: various improvements to creating Linux VMs (#3472)\r\n* (iOS) Add licensing text to app settings (#3236)\r\n* (macOS) DMG package now has a pretty icon and background (#3257)\r\n* (macOS) Add new preference to terminate when all windows are closed (previously this was the default) (#3483)\r\n* (macOS) Fix custom icon for Apple VMs (#3477)\r\n* (macOS) Fix retina mode support for QEMU VMs (note that previously there was a global preference to enable retina mode that is now removed, per-VM setting should be used instead) (#3471)\r\n* (macOS) Remove QEMU VM setting for \"Fit to Screen\" as it was never implemented for macOS\r\n* ~~(macOS) Remove Apple VM setting for \"Retina (HiDPI) Mode\" as it was confusing and is not used for rendering (it just specifies the size of the virtual monitor)~~ This has been reverted in v3.0.4 and the Retina (HiDPI) Mode has been added back. A use for this feature is if you wish to take screenshots at specific resolutions.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.0.2)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed drive delete/move buttons not appearing on macOS 11 (#3461)\r\n* (macOS) Added missing network entitlement for bridged networking on Apple VMs\r\n* (macOS) Wizard: convert VHDX to QCOW2 when creating a Windows VM\r\n* (macOS) Any imported drive on an interface that is NOT floppy, pflash, or none will be converted to QCOW2.
